Marketing aims to influence people with the use of various techniques, digital signage is one of them. In this document, using the concepts of marketing and digital signage,  improvements and new functionalities over the \emph{Sistema Inteligente de Divulgação de Informações do IFG - Formosa} (SID) are implemented. The new version of the system has several differences from the previous one. Among them is the complete integration with Facebook, which was previously limited; more interactivity in the presentation of the news, enabling the user to interact  through the social network over the publications; creation of a mobile application which made possible to show the publications registered in the system and also allows the communication between teachers and students. This last application was developed aiming future integration with the \emph{Sistema de Gestão Acadêmica} (SGA) IFB system.
